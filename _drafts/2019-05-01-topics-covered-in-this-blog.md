## What about? 

- Stuff you're curious about, maybe even good at, "Passions".
- Or content catered to your audience.

In the case of this blog, several topics should show up in the blog feed:

1. Code
When you discover code and write your first automations (VBA macros in my case, as a fund analyst intern back in 2015), you quickly realise what an amazing tool it can be to make just about everything easier, not even mentioning the advancements this could bring to your career as you quickly stand out from the group as the one having magic fingers in your team, even when you're not a "real" developer and only have a few handy tricks up your sleeves for everyday office tasks.
Code also opens wide the doors of creation, once you understood the basics, you can eventually make about anything and with almost no barriers of entry, be it business-oriented or simply creative, all you need is to acquire the skills through your job or side-projects if it doesn't imply any.

2. Lifestyle
Nomad and office lifestyles, thoughts on management, personal development applied to team work...

3. China & Mandarin
My current work is related to China
