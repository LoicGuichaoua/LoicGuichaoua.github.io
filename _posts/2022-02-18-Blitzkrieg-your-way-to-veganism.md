>movies list to veganism

<br>

You're probably here because you had a talk with a friend about the impact of the food you eat.  
And either the ethics, environmental or health aspect of what your friend said left you wanting to know more.  

Here's a straightforward list of documentaries that you can watch to get a hold of what's really going on behind your plate.  

The idea here is not to throw violent images at you, instead I've selected "non-violent" documentaries for you to watch in order to gain a basic understanding of the issue, without having to have a terrible time in the process.  

## My Recommendation

To gain a basic understanding of what's going on:
1. Cowspiracy <a href="https://www.netflix.com/fr-en/title/80033772" target="_blank">Netflix</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/kxMBrqDvFhE" target="_blank">Youtube</a>
2. Seaspiracy <a href="https://www.netflix.com/fr-en/title/81014008" target="_blank">Netflix</a>

Not enough? Watch these to see what's going on, without any filters:
1. [Dominion](https://youtu.be/LQRAfJyEsko) or [Earthlings](https://youtu.be/8gqwpfEcBjI)
2. [The Damned: Stories of Slaughterhouse Workers (in French)](https://youtu.be/Trge8blO_hI)


## Other easy to watch documentaries:
- The Game Changers  
- Food, Inc  
- Forks over Knives
