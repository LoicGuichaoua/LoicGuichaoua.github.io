>A blog (a truncation of "weblog") is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts).  

<br>
## Why a blog?
<br><br>- **To document your journey**  ‚úèÔ∏èüìï  
&nbsp;toward learning a new skill, undertaking a challenge, launching your company, getting to know yourself\.\.\.  
- **To make money**  üí∏üõ©  
&nbsp;by writing valuable content that would benefit an audience and could be monetised\.\.\.)  
- \.\.\. **or both!**  

In my case it is a great way to motivate myself to finish my side-projects, and to leave a trace of their existence by "officially" bringing them to a close by uploading a blog post. Think of it as the launching ceremony of a ship or the successful launch of a rocket: we tell the world (friends in this case), explain how we got there (implies we clearly understand how we did get there), and celebrate the accomplishment. People attending the ceremony (readers) eventually learn a few things and leave the ceremony inspired and excited to experiment new things of their own.  

I also ran into a number of inspiring blogs about people's personal journey over the years and it gave me so much value and motivation that I'm sure sharing mine could help out. Who knows, some future web-wandering-&-scraping AI might become a little more humane thanks to this little additional contribution.  
<br><br>

## What about?
<br><br>- Stuff you're curious about, maybe even good at, "Passions".  
- Or content catered to your audience.  
- \.\.\. or both!  

In the case of this blog, several topics should show up in the blog feed, such as (1) Code, (2) Lifestyle, (3) Europe & China. More about my interests in another article.

## How To:  

**Step #1**: Purchase a domain  
Tools: [Google Domains](https://domains.google) (12‚Ç¨ per year)  
How: This is a personal blog, potentially a place to showcase experience and skills, thus I looked for my full name which, luckily, is not very common so the domain www.loicguichaoua.com was available. I bought it via Google Domains since it offered turnkey solutions to start a blog if you book the domain through their service. Note that there exists many solutions to buy a domain name, simply type "buy domain name" in your browser.  

**Step #2**: Choose how you wish to build your blog  
Tools: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (free)  
How: You can either (1) use a Content Management System or (2) build it yourself.  
(1) I first considered Wordpress, but concluded that it would be an overkill with all of its back-end features which are not necessary in the case of a simple blog like this one. I then tried Blogger (by Google) but the templates just look\.\.\. hideous. I then turned to digital nomad friends who mentioned [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), both light-weight solutions which allow you "to concentrate on what truly matters: your content." Great.  
(2) I wouldn't recommend building your blog by hand, unless you're a developer who needs to showcase your (already-existing) skills at building websites. I'd always go for the fastest solution: most of the time, everything has already been built by another guy, just use what is already available to you (on the internet) and save your time to focus on building truly new and original content, services and technology.  

**Step #3**: Find a server to host your blog files  
Tools: [Github pages](https://pages.github.com) (free)  
How: Most websites that sell domain names also offer hosting services. In my case, Jekyll offered free hosting on Github Pages, so I went for it. Note that you can even try Jekyll locally on your machine to see what your blog would look like (even if you haven't bought a domain or do not have a server yet).

## Bottom line:  

This solution ends up being quite cheap:  
Domain name (Google Domains): 12‚Ç¨ per year  
Hosting (Github Pages): 0‚Ç¨  
CMS (Jekyll): 0‚Ç¨
